TODO
----
- trayscript if ~/.config/jwmtools/trayscript.sh is not found, show missing script path instead of empty label
- SCreateAppend didn't failed at compilation when I passed char* instead of int
- SCreate with more parameters, ideally unlimited SCreate("hello",name,"!")
- trayusermount cd/dvd support
  - pmount /dev/dvd
  - pumount dvd
  - when blocked by some process (e.g. mc), print which process is blocking umount
- calendar (there is some component in glade, should be easy enough), current "cal -3 | gmessage -file -" is not very usefull
- proper "turn off dialog" (also with reboot, logout, etc..), currently gmessage (and poweroff if confirmed)
- battery applet
- trayscript should on click run `mousepad ~/.config/jwmtools/trayscript.sh` so that I can edit it more easily
- monitoring daemon which will monitor /sys for connected second keyboard and re-run given setxkbmap command so that it would apply to both keyboards
  otherwise 2nd connected keyboard does not have these settings

Wishlist
--------
- tray applet with frequently used applications (next to launchers)
- something for simple CD/DVD clonning
- system menu (parameter for appmenugen to show only system categories or something)
